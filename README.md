**Implementation of the following task:**

We need to implement showing pages that return from PageViewService and be able to
**paginate it using paginator control**

#### Modify code in order to:
* Fix issues and see the display of pages
* Be able to list pages via paginator component
* Fix all injection issues with the PageViewService
* Implement filter field which will allow to filter pages by name
* Organize components in a way you like 
* Organize components within a separate module
* Fix tslint issues.
* Get rid of "any" typing

#### Please note:
* You're free to skip any part of the task if you're not comfortable with it - just note the reason why
* If you're not able to finalize in time just write the list of TODO items you need to accomplish
* We're heavily using rxjs so using it would be a great plus 
* We're using Reactive forms so using them for the filter control will be a great plus
* Styling of the components is optional - do it if you have time 
* If you see any potential issues in the code please mark them with TODO item and describe what should 
be done in order to fix it
